We characterized the bacterial resistome from untreated sewage from 79 sites in 60 countries. We found systematic differences in abundance and diversity of AMR genes between Europe/North-America/Oceania and Africa/Asia/South-America. Antimicrobial use data only explained a minor part of the AMR variation and no evidence for cross-selection between antimicrobial classes nor effect of travel by flight between sites were found. However, AMR abundance was strongly correlated with socio-economic, health and environmental factors, which we used to predict AMR abundances in all countries in the world. Our findings suggest that the global AMR gene diversity and abundance varies by region and are caused by national circumstances. Improving sanitation and health could potentially limit the global burden of AMR. We propose to use sewage for an ethically acceptable and economically feasible continuous global surveillance and prediction of AMR.", "study-name": "Global surveillance of antimicrobial resistance", "data-origination": "SUBMITTED", "last-update": "2021-11-17T00:54:21"}, "relationships": {"biomes": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005847/biomes"}, "data": [{"type": "biomes", "id": "root:Engineered:Wastewater:Water and sludge", "links": {"self": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Engineered:Wastewater:Water%20and%20sludge"}}]}, "publications": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005847/publications"}}, "geocoordinates": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005847/geocoordinates"}}, "downloads": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005847/downloads"}}, "analyses": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005847/analyses"}}, "samples": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005847/samples"}}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005847"}}, {"type": "studies", "id": "MGYS00005802", "attributes": {"samples-count": 6, "accession": "MGYS00005802", "bioproject": "PRJEB43967", "is-private": false, "secondary-accession": "ERP127957", "centre-name": "EMG", "public-release-date": null, "study-abstract": "The Third Party Annotation (TPA) assembly was derived from the primary whole genome shotgun (WGS) data set PRJEB8087, and was assembled with SPAdes v3.11.1, metaSPAdes v3.12.0.

However, little is known about their physiology and ecological importance. In this study, an OTU belonging to Acetothermia was identified as one of the most abundant genus-level bacterial taxa in full-scale mesophilic anaerobic digesters at two Danish wastewater treatment plants. A closed genome was obtained by differential coverage binning of metagenomes and long Nanopore reads. Genome annotation and metabolic reconstruction revealed an anaerobic chemoheterotrophic lifestyle in which the bacterium obtain energy and carbon from the fermentation of peptides, amino acids, and simple sugars to acetate, formate and hydrogen. In contrast to previously studied Acetothermia, the genome did not encode a functional acetyl-CoA pathway required for acetogenesis. Fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting Acetothermia were designed and used in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy and atomic force microscopy. This revealed an unusual morphology composed of a central rod cell with bipolar prosthecae similar to those observed in Caulobacter and Asticcacaulis. These prosthecae greatly expand the cell surface to volume ratio and allow for increased nutrient uptake, providing the bacteria with a competitive advantage under nutrient limited conditions.", "study-name": "Unusual ecophysiology of Candidate phylum Acetothermia bacteria associated with anaerobic digesters revealed by complete genome sequencing and advanced in situ microscopy", "data-origination": "SUBMITTED", "last-update": "2020-05-22T02:28:51"}, "relationships": {"biomes": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005432/biomes"}, "data": [{"type": "biomes", "id": "root:Engineered:Wastewater", "links": {"self": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Engineered:Wastewater"}}]}, "publications": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005432/publications"}}, "geocoordinates": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005432/geocoordinates"}}, "downloads": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005432/downloads"}}, "analyses": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005432/analyses"}}, "samples": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005432/samples"}}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005432"}}, {"type": "studies", "id": "MGYS00002319", "attributes": {"samples-count": 4, "accession": "MGYS00002319", "bioproject": "PRJEB24354", "is-private": false, "secondary-accession": "ERP106170", "centre-name": "EMBL-EBI", "public-release-date": null, "study-abstract": "The sludge metagenome Third Party Annotation (TPA) assembly was derived from the primary whole genome shotgun (WGS) data set: PRJNA427366.

Because these morphotypes differ only in their filament diameters, they are often considered together in surveys based on microscopic identifications.

Amplicon sequencing data of Australian EBPR plant biomass containing types 0041 and 0675 was utilized to achieve this. Roche 454 amplicon data generated by the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF) V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Analysis and FISH probes designed against several of these amplicon sequences indicated that these two morphotypes were members of the phylum Chloroflexi. Subsequent surveys of full-scale plant biomass samples showed these two filaments were common in these systems. However, considerable further diversity appears to exist and therefore should be a subject of further research.", "study-name": "Identification of filamentous Chloroflexi morphotypes in Activated

The microbial community completing the anaerobic digestion process is considered complex, and several attempts already have been carried out to determine the key microbial populations. However, the key differences in the anaerobic digestion microbiomes, and the environmental/process parameters that drive these differences, remain poorly understood. In this research, we hypothesized that differences in operational parameters lead to a particular composition and organization of microbial communities in full-scale installations. A total of 38 samples were collected from 29 different full-scale anaerobic digestion installations, showing constant biogas production in function of time. Microbial community analysis was carried out by means of amplicon sequencing and real-time PCR. The bacterial community in all samples was dominated by representatives of the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, covering 86.1 \u00b1 10.7% of the total bacterial community. Acetoclastic methanogenesis was dominated by Methanosaetaceae, yet, only the hydrogenotrophic Methanobacteriales correlated with biogas production, confirming their importance in high-rate anaerobic digestion systems. In-depth analysis of operational and environmental parameters and bacterial community structure indicated the presence of three potential clusters in anaerobic digestion. These clusters were determined by total ammonia concentration, free ammonia concentration and temperature, and characterized by an increased relative abundance of Bacteroidales, Clostridiales and Lactobacillales, respectively. None of the methanogenic populations, however, could be significantly attributed to any of the three clusters.

The present study aimed at the characterization of the bacterial diversity in a field-pilot bioreactor treating extremely As-rich AMD in situ. Inside the bioreactor, the bacterial communities responsible for iron and arsenic removal formed a biogenic precipitate. These communities evolved from a structure at first similar to the one of the feed water used as an inoculum to a structure similar to the natural ecosystem developing in situ in the AMD. Diverse FeOB populations largely dominated the bioreactor including: Gallionella, Ferrovum, Leptospirillum, Acidithiobacillus, Ferritrophicum,\u2026 Notable shifts were observed in the distribution of these populations inside the bioreactor. Appreciable arsenite oxidation occurring in the bioreactor could be linked to the presence of Thiomonas related bacteria. The spatio-temporal dynamics of the whole communities were tightly linked to variations in the physico-chemistry of the AMD water transiting inside the bioreactor. The main parameters that proved to exert a control on the bacterial communities potentially involved in the water treatment process were: DO, temperature, pH, dissolved sulfates, arsenic and Fe(II) concentrations and redox potential. The ubiquity and the physiological diversity of the bacteria identified (including the genus of biotechnological relevance Ferrovum) suggested that this treatment system could be easily adapted to the treatment of AMD with a large range of physico-chemical characteristics.", "study-name": "Dynamics of bacterial communities mediating the treatment of an as-rich acid mine drainage in a field-scale pilot", "data-origination": "SUBMITTED", "last-update": "2018-08-14T09:30:45"}, "relationships": {"biomes": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002707/biomes"}, "data": [{"type": "biomes", "id": "root:Engineered:Wastewater:Industrial wastewater:Mine water", "links": {"self": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Engineered:Wastewater:Industrial%20wastewater:Mine%20water"}}]}, "publications": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002707/publications"}}, "geocoordinates": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002707/geocoordinates"}}, "downloads": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002707/downloads"}}, "analyses": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002707/analyses"}}, "samples": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002707/samples"}}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002707"}}, {"type": "studies", "id": "MGYS00002398", "attributes": {"samples-count": 1, "accession": "MGYS00002398", "bioproject": "PRJEB27138", "is-private": false, "secondary-accession": "ERP109181", "centre-name": "University of Szeged", "public-release-date": null, "study-abstract": "Amplicon sequencing of urban water samples by Illumina technology", "study-name": "Metagenomic sequencing of water samples", "data-origination": "SUBMITTED", "last-update": "2018-06-08T14:08:30"}, "relationships": {"biomes": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002398/biomes"}, "data": [{"type": "biomes", "id": "root:Engineered:Wastewater", "links": {"self": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Engineered:Wastewater"}}]}, "publications": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002398/publications"}}, "geocoordinates": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002398/geocoordinates"}}, "downloads": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002398/downloads"}}, "analyses": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002398/analyses"}}, "samples": {"links": {"related": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002398/samples"}}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002398"}}, {"type": "studies", "id": "MGYS00002383", "attributes": {"samples-count": 6, "accession": "MGYS00002383", "bioproject": "PRJEB26809", "is-private": false, "secondary-accession": "ERP108828", "centre-name": "UNIVERSITY OF GOTHENBURG", "public-release-date": null, "study-abstract": "In this work, we have examined sludge samples from a Croatian azithromycin production plant using shotgun metagenomics, to better understand the full diversity of known resistance genes, mobile genetic elements and the impact on taxonomic composition caused by extensive antibiotic selection pressures.

WWTP effluent adds nutrients and chemicals into streams and follows well-documented hydrological mixing patterns based on dilution. However, the hydrological mixing of planktonic microbial communities is less well-documented. We tested whether environmental DNA (eDNA) sampled from 24 headwater streams and WWTP effluent flowing into the economically important Rhine River followed predicted dilution patterns and characterized the bacterial communities using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Total eDNA recovered from the effluent lacked a quantitative mixing relationship with receiving streams, suggesting that eDNA is influenced by more than hydrological dilution. The downstream 16S profiles highlighted a decrease in Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria taxa and an increase in Firmicutes and TM7 taxa compared to the upstream. All resulting sequences were assigned in silico habitat descriptors, and these habitat descriptors matched expected values for the effluent (e.g., \u201cwastewater\u201d) and upstream (e.g., \u201cfreshwater lake\u201d, \u201criver\u201d) for most streams, whereas the downstream habitat descriptors were a mixture between the two.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive microbial community survey by using 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing of 148 digester sludge samples from 90 full-scale digesters at 51 municipal wastewater treatment plants from North America, Europe, and East Asia. Among the samples, eight different types of community structures were identified, among which the largest one could serve as a model structure of digester microbiome. Relatively mild community changes were induced by moderate temperature fluctuation, while drastic community changes were caused by pretreatment, high salinity and high temperature. Within each type, we identified the signature microbial populations that were associated with the operating conditions. By performing pairwise comparisons between the microbiomes in the feed to and within the digesters, microbial populations that were likely resides as result of incomplete digestion were identified.

It was  hypothesized that microbial growth in response to dissolved organic carbon (DOC)  availability would establish more robust and diverse microbial communities, leading to  enhanced TOrC biodegradation and sorption to biological material. This hypothesis was  evaluated in TOrC-spiked microcosm and column experiments, utilizing a representative  microbial consortium from actual runoff and DOC extracted from straw and compost.  Microcosms with compost DOC exhibited broader TOrC biodegradation potential than  microcosms with raw runoff or straw DOC. 16s rRNA gene sequencing revealed  community clustering according to DOC type, suggesting that DOC availability caused  shifts in community structure that affected TOrC biodegradation. Columns exhibited  enhanced biological TOrC attenuation in presence ofbiofilms established with compost  DOC but not straw DOC.

In this study, the pollutant removal performance and microbial diversity were revealed in a long run (over 300 days) bench scale sequential anaerobic-aerobic biosystem treating coking wastewater. Anaerobic treatment could remove one third of COD and more than half of phenols at a hydraulic retention time of 42 hours, while the combined system with a total HRT of 114 hours removed COD, TOC, total phenols, thiocyanate and cyanide by 81.6?3.3%, 85.2?4.2%, 99.9?0.02%, 98.2?0.3, 87.2?3.9% respectively. Comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis revealed almost complete removal of phenol derivatives and nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds (NHCs) by the combination in which anaerobic process alone contributed in average 58.4% and 59.1% removal, respectively. In order to appraise microbial activity in bioreactors, the bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing. Proteobacteria (relative abundance 61.2 - 93.4%), particularly Betaproteobacteria (34.4-70.1%) were the most predominant bacterial group. Phenol degrading and hydrolytic bacteria like Ottowia (14.1-46.7%), Soehngenia (3.0-8.2%) and Corynebacterium (0.9-12.0%) were most abundant genera in anaerobic sludge, whereas in aerobic sludge Thiobacillus (6.6- 43.6%), Diaphorobacter (5.1-13.1%) and Comamonas (0.2-11.1%)were speculated as major degraders of phenol, thiocyanate and NHCs, respectively.

operational problem worldwide. Filaments with the Eikelboom 0092 morphotype are commonly associated with such bulking episodes. Members of the uncultured B45 phylotype, which is embraced within the phylum Chloroflexi, were recently shown to exhibit this morphology. Although these organisms are among the most abundant populations recorded in activated sludge processes, nothing is known about their metabolic characteristics. In this study, a genome sequence, representing the phylotype, was retrieved from a metagenome generated from an activated sludge WWTP plant. The genome consisted of two chromosomes and one plasmid, which were 4.0, 1.0, and 0.04 Mbps in size, respectively. A metabolic model was constructed for this organism, based on annotation of its genome, showing its ability to generate energy by aerobic respiration, utilizing oxygen, nitrite, or nitrous oxide as electron acceptors, or by fermentation of sugars. This model was validated partially in situ. The provisional name of Candidatus ?Promineofilum breve? is proposed for this species. This study represents the first detailed information on an uncultured genus of filamentous organisms from activated sludge.", "study-name": "Genomic and in situ investigations of the novel uncultured
